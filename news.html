<h1><b>1 st S-400 missile deployed,Threat for Pak and China</h1>
<img src='s400.PNG'><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) has deployed first squadron of Russia-made S-400 missile system in the Punjab sector to boost country’s aerial power in an attempt to thwart any threats from Pakistan and China.
“The first squadron is being deployed in the Punjab sector. The batteries of the first squadron would be capable of taking care of aerial threats from both Pakistan and China," a government official was quoted as saying by ANI on condition of anonymity.
Earlier this month, foreign secretary Harsh V Shringla had announced that Russia has started deliveries of the surface-to-air long-range missile system. Shringla’s statement came soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India.
During Putin’s day-long visit, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov praised the S-400 air defence missile systems deal between his country and India, saying the United States tried to strong-arm India into opting out of the pact but New Delhi went through anyway.
Last month Russia had trained a group of Indian personnel to operate the first regiment of the Triumf S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Alexander Mikheyev, the head of Russia’s state-run military firm Rosoboronexport, told news agency TASS that a number of Russian experts will visit India in early January to oversee the installation of the weapons at the sites where it will be stationed.
He said Russia has already trained “Indian specialists" to operate the S-400 systems. “The Indian specialists who will operate the first regiment set have completed their training and returned home," the Rosoboronexport chief said on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow.
In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.
The Biden administration has not yet clarified whether it will impose sanctions on India under the provisions of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for procuring the S-400 missile systems. The CAATSA, which was brought in 2017, provides for punitive actions against any country engaged in transactions with Russian defence and intelligence sectors.
The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the CAATSA for the purchase of a batch of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia. The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.
Following the US sanctions on Turkey, there were apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures on India. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, during a visit to India two months ago, said that any country deciding to use the S-400 missiles is “dangerous" and not in anybody’s security interest.
At the same time, she hoped that the US and India will be able to resolve differences over the procurement. It is learnt that the matter is being discussed between India and the US.
Russia has been one of India’s key major suppliers of arms and ammunition.

<h1><b>Afganisthan Falls,US rapid exit named as reason</h1>
<p>Terming the situation in Afghanistan as “very fragile”, India has said it is important that the Taliban adheres to its commitment to not allow the use of the Afghan soil for terrorism, including from terror groups designated under Security Council resolution 1267 that lists Pakistan-based outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.
Earlier on Friday, claiming that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has put 20 years of steady economic gains at risk, the United Nations development agency says that Afghanistan is teetering on the brink of “universal poverty” which could become a reality in the middle of next year unless urgent efforts are made to bolster local communities and their economies.
Meanwhile, U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons has warned that the Taliban have already “visibly welcomed and sheltered” al-Qaeda members.<br>

On Thursday, in a first such large-scale departure since U.S. forces completed their frantic withdrawal over a week ago, an estimated 200 foreigners, including Americans, left Afghanistan on a commercial flight out of Kabul on Thursday with the cooperation of the Taliban.
Although the White House praised the Taliban for their “businesslike” and “professional” cooperation in facilitating the departure of American citizens and lawful permanent residents on charter flights, the U.S., however, said that the interim Taliban government does not reflect what the international community and the United States hoped to see.

<h1><b>Aadhar linked to voter id,Opposition seeks clarification</h1>
<img src='aadhar.PNG'>
<p>New Delhi: The linking of Aadhaar and voter ID cards will be "voluntary and not compulsory", Law Minister Kiren Rijiju told NDTV Tuesday, amid spiraling protests against the controversial Election Laws (Amendment) Bill and the equally controversial manner in which it was rushed through Parliament
"It would be voluntary and not compulsory to link voter ID card with Aadhaar. Even if a citizen does not have an Aadhaar card, his name will not be deleted from electoral rolls. If you are above 18 and your name is in the voting list... then you are a voter," Mr Rijiju told NDTV.
"The Election Laws Bill is necessary to make the electoral process clean and tidy... Right now, one voter gets his/her name included in the electoral roll at three or four places. It is very important to remove those who are fake voters," the minister said.
"The opposition's argument is absolutely wrong... they have no basis" he stressed.
Yesterday too Mr Rijiju batted for the bill, telling news agency ANI the opposition had been asked to participate and voice their opinions in the discussion, but instead they created chaos.
However, furious opposition leaders lashed out at the government for the way in which the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill was passed - in the Lok Sabha on Monday evening and in the Rajya Sabha today - in the course of a few hours and without any real debate on possible flaws.
Congress MP Mallikarjun Kharge, the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, said the Election Laws Bill had been passed without "discussion or debate"; he called it "mockery of our democracy".
Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien was suspended for the rest of the winter session after he was accused of throwing the rule book at the Rajya Sabha Chair during protests over the bill.
Speaking to NDTV shortly afterwards, Mr O'Brien repeatedly highlighted how the bill (and others in the past) had been pushed past the opposition MPs, and red-flagged the "murder of Parliament".
In the Rajya Sabha earlier Mr O'Brien had cited the rule book to argue that the bill was being pushed through without enough notice to leaders of opposition parties.
Harivansh Narayan Singh, the Chair at the time, said the shorter notice was allowed under the rules.
The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill allows electoral registration officers to seek the Aadhaar number of people who want to register as voters "for the purpose of establishing identity".
Thus, the possibility of electors whose names appear more than once can be removed, government sources have told news agency PTI. This will help "cleaning" the electoral roll and facilitate voter registration at locations at which they are 'ordinarily resident', the sources added.
The bill also seeks to make statutes gender-neutral by substituting the term 'wife' with 'spouse' to allow husbands of service voters to vote from their wives' duty stations.
